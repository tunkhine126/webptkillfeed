# Overwatch Killfeed
Coding assessment for WebPT - create an app to consume an Overwatch killfeed API.

## Requirements
The url for the test api end point is: http://interview.wptdev.com/api/killfeed. The feed will be started approximately 24 hours prior to your interview. This is an open ended 'test'. Just pick any language you feel is most appropriate and write something to consume the data from the end point. At WebPT, we primarily use a tech stack consisting of React, Typescript, Javascript and Node or Ruby on Rails on the backend; however, please use the language of your choosing to show your creativity as you see fit. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on the assignment but be sure to use the full 2 hours to build as much as you can to highlight some of your skills.

Do not be overly concerned with the limited time. Most candidates' code is unfinished when the 2 hours expires. Just be prepared to walk us through what you did and what you were planning to do next, during your interview.

## Additional features and plans for this app given more time:

- Separate api call into its on JS file
- Add Cypress testing framework
- Linting
